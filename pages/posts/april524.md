# Hello again,

I came to update my resume as of my recent resignation from New Paths Inc. I'm in search of new full time employment where I can leverage and grow my programming skills. I need to get back into programming as the past few months I have been pretty hands off. Maybe we will see some more projects soon! 

See you soon!

# Hey,

I just wanted to take a moment and say thank you for coming to check out my portfolio website. I began developing this site on 12/18/2023.

Originally I planned on making some elaborate complex portfolio site to display my skills, however, I decided to keep it simple to start and expand the complexity and features with time. I'm not much of a blogger, but i'll try to add updates here and get in to the habit of updating this frequently. I just wanted to say thank you again for stopping by and I hope you come back soon!
